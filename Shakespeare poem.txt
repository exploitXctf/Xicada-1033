In the light of the moon, I walk alone
Not able to say what I want
Real feelings, such real feelings
Without knowing them, time marches on

If this song could someday reach you
Then surely, it would have meaning just for that
Even if it seems laughable, just pretty words

I get a feeling every time I go to bed
Are you thinking about me or is it all just in my head?
'Cause I'm fallin' at the speed of light
Can't keep up with the butterflies
Floating 'round, no sign of slowing down

I remember your awkwardness, too
You'd cry without speaking of your pain
These ambiguous feelings, I adore you In my dreams
one day, this will become a beautiful memory

"Who is this song meant to touch?"
Honestly, maybe no one knows
Still, we—stubborn and relentless—
Keep searching for something to shake our souls
